        * 2016 to present

        * Administrator of bioinformatics forum on the slack platform

        * This workspace represents a new generation of international microbial
        bioinformaticians, with direct links to peers in all international major
        public health services, public health institutions, and affiliated
        universities.

        * I developed a code of conduct for the forum, which describes actions
        not permitted, and actions that the administrators can take when there
        is a violation. 

        * The purpose is strictly not a help desk but is a place to get help
        directly from the source, e.g., understanding undocumented workflows or
        putting forth ideas directly with the author of a software package.

        * Another purpose is collaboration, e.g., creation of a suitable
        metagenomics database and direct distribution to users worldwide. 

        * Slack board collaboration has resulted in at least three publications:
        Page et al 2017 (senior author: Katz), Zhou et al "GrapeTree" 2018, and
        Robertson et al "SISTR" 2018.

        * Stats as of 2021-10-13
          * 287k messages sent 
          * 74 public channels/topics
          * 1.5k members
          * There are six other administrators, working from UK, Canada, Portugal, Australia, and Vietnam.

        A select few from CDC are chosen to have breakfast with the director of
        CDC to discuss ideas.  I was able to introduce the idea of a
        bioinformatics internship program with the director.  Since then,
        several higher-level committees have been discussing how best to
        implement an internship program with several universities such as GA
        Tech.  This eventually culminated, driven by higher-ups at CDC and not
        driven by me, into a bioinformatics fellowship under APHL.

        * Facilitating interagency whole genome sequencing standards and
        analysis working group. This is a working group under the Genomics Food
        Safety collaboration (Gen-FS) between CDC, FDA, USDA, and NCBI. 
        Determination of fact-based thresholds for whole genome sequencing to
        aid in the missions of CDC, FDA, USDA, and NCBI.  Creation of whole
        genome sequencing benchmark datasets.  Creation of a data download
        script.  Datasets and script published in Timme et al 2017.  I am senior
        author.  I have also reached out to other labs at CDC including the
        Legionella lab to help contribute datasets.  We meet once a month, and I
        facilitate the calls and record notes for the group.

        * Facilitating international workgroup under the Global Microbial
        Identifier (GMI).  My workgroup (workgroup 3) focuses on data
        analytics.  Benchmark datasets from Gen-FS have been donated to this
        group and we have collected datasets from international partners.  

        * Advisor for GIGte, the monthly division-wide workshop in
        bioinformatics

        * Member of MCT-DART
          * In this role, I won an FIA to purchase a node in the SciComp cluster which we named Spaceball1.  Although it costs $80k, it will save money long-term because no one will need to buy individual workstations.  It is also more powerful than all or most individual computers at CDC right now.
