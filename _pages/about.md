This is the professional and personal website for Lee Katz.

Lee Katz is the senior bioinformatician in the Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch at CDC.  He graduated with a PhD in bioinformatics in 2010 from GA Tech and has worked at CDC since then.  Since joining CDC, Lee has worked on several high profile projects: studying the evolutionary dynamics of the Haiti cholera outbreak and also aiding PulseNet in using whole genome sequencing (WGS) for genomic epidemiology.  Lee has also worked on many software projects for public health including the Lyve-SET SNP pipeline for genomic epidemiology, the rapid tree-making pipeline for WGS (Mashtree), and the QA/QC system for bacterial WGS in public health (SneakerNet).  In his free time, Lee tries to be a good husband and parent, and in his imaginary free time, he podcasts with his co-hosts on the Micro Binfie podcast.
