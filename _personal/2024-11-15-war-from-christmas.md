Today while I was raking leaves, my neighbor asked me if I was going to take my kids to the [Pink Pig](https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2024/08/05/macys-pink-pig-ride-returns-for-georgia-festival-of-trees/).
I didn't really have an answer ready to go, but my wife is really sharp and simply said, "they're Jewish."  
"Oh right," I thought. I never went out of my way to do anything for Christmas growing up.

I said that I hadn't really thought about it and that growing up, I didn't like having Christian things shoved in my face.
And then the conversation went downhill from there with her mentioning that she has friends who are Jewish.
Despite my own harsh rhetoric, I tried to save/stop the conversation by gently saying, "and that's all to say why I never bothered with the Pink Pig."

But that's frustrating -- I have had this conversation countless times without trying to take the time to articulate it fully.
We have had the so called ["War on Christmas"](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/18/war-on-christmas-525273),
but growing up, I had to deal with the War _from_ Christmas.

## Growing up

Every year in school, there would be Christmas this or Christmas that.
Chorus, orchestra, and band would all trumpet Christmas to us.
Decorations around the school.
A Christmas candy exchange.
There would be micro actions too like surprise when someone asked me about my Christmas tree and I would say that I don't have one.
Or another was during Pesach and people would be surprised that I wasn't eating bread.

But wait! They would always try to balance it out with something Hannukah themed.
They'd have a Dreidle, Dreidle, Dreidle song in the middle of chorus.
Menorah decorations placed in all the correct places in the school hallway.
Gelt shuffled in with the candy.
That's fair, right?

Not really.
Growing up Jewish was difficult.
Don't get me wrong -- I LIKE who I am and how I grew up.
However, three or five hours each Saturday praying was difficult for a kid like me when all I wanted to do was watch cartoons or whatever else kids do.
Hebrew school for a few hours on Sundays was difficult but I am glad I learned so much.
Then there are so many other things which yes I mostly enjoyed but I was exhausted.

I also didn't want to be the token Jewish guy that everyone wanted to appease.
I didn't want them to look at me between Christmas songs so that they could verify that they checked the box.
I also didn't want to be in a position where I had to put on my Jewish identity in a secular place.
I know that this sounds sort of rude but no I didn't want to do Jewish things at School.
And then I certainly didn't want to have to be blasted with Christmas either. It's not like I could leave the school mandated holiday party, either and so like the immature kid I was, I held my hands over my ears sometimes. Other times I just took it.
And be honest, would _you_ want to be blasted with a random religion every single year?

## Now that I'm an adult

I've grown out of this however.
I think that the Christmas lights are pretty
and that it's fun to listen to some music.
I don't think that I am ready to go out of my way to decorate my house to the teeth with Christmas.
However, I'm ready for my kids to experience whatever life gives them.

üç∑ L'chaim!
