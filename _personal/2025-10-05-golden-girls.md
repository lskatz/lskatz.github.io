Samantha took me on a date yesterday to see the
[Golden Girls Murder Mystery](https://www.withoutacue.com/goldengirls).

It's been a tough week yet again and I guess I'll try to say as much as possible in a factual way instead of bringing in my opinions.
On Monday, I was getting excited to start trying to frame how genomic epidemiology would work in meningitis land.
I was drafting a few things on that topic.
By the end of the day, I was also looking at what either
[Allele codes](https://github.com/ncezid-biome/AlleleCodes)
or what
[LINCodes](https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/cgmlst-lincodes/)
might bring to the table.
I get really excited about this, and I know that it would improve life in the US if it were implemented.

However, and this is factual, the federal government lapsed in federal appropriations for this fiscal year.
This means that there is no money to pay my salary.
Simultaneously, it is also illegal for me to work for free.
Therefore, on Tuesday, I followed the procedure for an orderly shutdown and ceased work.

I have been furloughed and so I have been trying to find the best uses of my time.
Our yard, for example, has been very overgrown and so we actually had time to trim plants and trees.
Or in the back yard, we were able to cut down some of the bamboo.

But the best lemonade, so to speak, has been going on a date to the Golden Girls Murder Mystery last night.
We had a great dinner beforehand, and then we went down the street to the venue.
There, we had time to get some excellent mixed drinks.
They also had a fun scavenger hunt before the main event started.

Some highlights were:

* They were great at improving when necessary
* Their acting was really great - I felt like they were the real Golden Girls
* The group's energy was great! So many people came in their own cosplay like with wigs. Everyone was laughing and enjoying it.
* ...I actually got the who/what/why correctly this time! Usually Samantha gets it but this was my first time.
