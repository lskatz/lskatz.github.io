I visited my brother in Philadelphia in February earlier this year and stopped by the Liberty Bell.
I knew that there were 
[a bunch of things happening in US politics](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/1229744819/1a-02-07-2025)
while I was off the clock such as USAID getting defunded.
So I thought it was funny in a dark way to send a picture of me next to the Liberty Bell back to my group.
(yay liberty - ?)

The next month in March, I took off work and went on the field trip with my son to the Georgia Capitol building.
I didn't realize this, but a copy of the Liberty Bell is outside of the capitol! I took a picture.
[The major political news of the day](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/1238535903/1a-nru-03-14-2025)
was a showdown between congress and the executive on whether to continue funding the government in light of the executive's assertion that they had the power to decide how to spend allocated funds.
Yay, democracy.

A short while later in April for Spring Break, we visited Savannah, GA.
Again, there were
[a bunch of things happening in US politics](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/11/1244093047/1a-nru-04-11-2025)
such as a man being sent to a foreign prison without due process.
Somehow, miraculously, a Liberty Bell was just around the corner from my hotel!
I took a picture.

Over the Summer, in our tradition of visiting hot places in hot months, we visited Las Vegas.
On the last day of our trip, I remembered that I hadn't come across a liberty bell by chance alone and so I looked it up.
I couldn't find any! But then I remembered that there is a 1/3-sized replica of the Statue of Liberty just a short walk away from our hotel.
We walked there and I took a picture.

Meanwhile, our executive illegally started a war with Iran.

Where should I go next?
