I visited my brother in Philadelphia in February earlier this year and stopped by the Liberty Bell.

The next month in March, I took off work and went on the field trip with my son to the Georgia Capitol building.
I didn't realize this, but a copy of the Liberty Bell is outside of the capitol! I took a picture.

A short while later in April for Spring Break, we visited Savannah, GA.
Somehow, miraculously, a Liberty Bell was just around the corner from my hotel!
I took a picture.

Over the Summer, in our tradition of visiting hot places in hot months, we visited Las Vegas.
On the last day of our trip, I remembered that I hadn't come across a liberty bell by chance alone and so I looked it up.
I couldn't find any! But then I remembered that there is a 1/3-sized replica of the Statue of Liberty just a short walk away from our hotel.
We walked there and I took a picture.

Where should I go next?
