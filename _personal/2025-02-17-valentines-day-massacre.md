I don't know what to do with all this but I don't want to forget the collective trauma we all had this weekend.

The stage was set from one of the many executive orders which illegally initiated a 
[reduction in force (RIF)](https://www.fedsmith.com/2025/02/12/executive-order-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization/).
Following that, the whole week starting on Feb 10, we were hearing about
[mass layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1iouytl/list_of_agencies_with_mass_layoffs_to/)
for many other agencies including
CFPB, OPM, Dept of Education, Dept of Energy, and GSA.

On February 13th, some of us were informally warned that we might start seeing layoffs at CDC.
We had be asked collectively who is one of these categories up until Jan 24.

* Title 42 (T42) - people who are researchers and who are not on a tenure track
* Probationary - people who are within one or two years of beginning their positions.

Personally, I had just switched from a T42 to a Title 5 (T5) probationary supervisor on Jan 26.
Therefore, I was on the T42 list formally. However, I had sent a correction showing that I am T5.

On Friday the 14th, it was verbally communicated that we would start seeing layoffs, by email, from the hours of 1pm to 4pm.
Personally, we were relieved that we did not see any emails coming to members of my team.
Other people were not so lucky.
Some whole programs like the EIS and LLS programs were cut off entirely.
I let my team know that they could relax for now, and then we all went off to enjoy our weekends.
Some of my friends went out to a bar to commiserate.
I heard of some people going off to enjoy their long weekend on road trips.
I went on a date with my wife to a comedy club.

In the middle of our date, I heard that no, they weren't done. They would be sending out notices until midnight on the next day the 15th.
The notices would be through email and upon receipt of reading the email, they would cut off network access.
They also reversed their decision to remove the EIS fellows but would keep their decision to remove the LLS fellows.

As of now I still haven't heard much about any emails going to my team members but the overall effect is chilling.
We are not allowed to even enjoy our weekends and are in fear of our jobs.
We are in fear of crucial people who could be let go.
I actually don't think the public understands how many different roles there are.
For example

* Human resources expert
* Biologist
* Epidemiologist
* Chemist
* Custodian
* Director
* Statistician

Each of these people might have some kind of crucial function that only they know how to do.
We work hard to make ourselves redundant at CDC but it is a difficult task.
For example at one point, I was the only one who knew how to upload _Listeria_ genomes from CDC.
I mean, I quickly rectified that, and so that wasn't the case after a while.
But there are countless things I have learned to do and then transferred that information to others.
And on top of that, there are countless others at CDC who have countless nonredundant tasks.

I am not making a political statement here but I am simply making the case that we are going through a traumatic experience,
and I wanted to try to retain these memories one way or another.
I am not looking forward to any future mass layoffs.
