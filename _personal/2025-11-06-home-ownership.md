My wife and I have been furloughed from our jobs since October 1 and we aren't sure when we're going to be able to work.
I want to be absolutely clear about this - we want to work, but
[it is actually illegal for us to do so](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/the-antideficiency-act-explained/).
It is even illegal for us to use any work equipment.
While we are stuck at home, we have decided to look over all the neglected things at our house.

## Trimmings

We trimmed the bamboo for about two or three days.

Then, we also trimmed a few short trees that are touching the house.

## Power washing

We noticed that we were slipping on our driveway and sidewalk a lot during all this and so we did power washing one day too!

This also reminded us that we needed to deal with the water drainage a bit on our sidewalk and so we placed some stones.
My wife and our kids colored some of them.

## Stumps

We saw were all the decomposing stumps in our yard.
Several trees were cut down probably five to ten years ago, which is _fine_ but now, in 2025, these are now becoming sink holes.
I dropped some pebbles down one of them and it went down into infinity which again might be _fine_, but these stumps are next to our house. Our foundation.
So I got like five bags (0.5 cubic feet each) of pea pebbles and threw them down the hole. They disappeared. I did it again and they mostly disappeared.

Here it is after 40 bags.

We put another 15 bags of topsoil to level it out.

We actually found an additional four stumps around the house and repeated this process.
In all, I think that we calculated that we used somewhere betweet 1.25 and 1.5 cubic yards of stone/dirt.

## Retaining wall

Next, we had a rough side yard where we had some erosion.
We decided to make a retaining wall. First, we dug a trench and then leveled it out.
Then, we added a garden cloth, then fine gravel, then heavy 40 pound blocks.

My wife knows a lot more than me about this kind of stuff, and so I tried to read up on it.
This is an excerpt from our book.

We mostly followed the instructions and it came out well!

## Irrigation

After the wall, we needed to fix up the water system.
One pipe is a drain from our driveway; the other is from our gutters.
We joined them and spraypainted them.

## Rain barrel

We also moved our rain barrel to the back yard.
We leveled out some land next to our back wall and put it on there.

Next, we cut a piece of the downspout and joined it with the rain barrel.

## Playground

Just for an extra thrill, we stained our playground in the back yard.
It should give it another year or two of life :)

## Light switches

My wife also did one more fun thing on the sly.
She printed and cut out these cool decals for our light switches!
I thought I'd end this post with a fun small thing instead of all these huge back breaking things! (oof!)

## Conclusion

...Is there actually a conclusion?
Because there are so many more projects to do and I am so tired!
And also, I'd rather be at work :/
