I was cleaning out my office and found a flag that was given to me a few years ago.
The legendary Peter Gerner-Smidt had become a citizen and had given some US flags to people in the branch.
Peter retired either at the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020
(in hindsight, a great time to retire!).

Here is the transcription:
> To LEE,  
> THE FIRST BIOINFORMATICIAN IN EDLB.  
> IN GRATITUDE FOR YOUR TIRELESS SERVICE TO THE BRANCH & YOUR COUNTRY  
> Peter

Obviously I have to keep this flag around forever :)
