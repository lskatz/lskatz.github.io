BioNumerics is [sunsetting in December 2024](https://www.applied-maths.com/news/bionumerics-phasing-out).
This is an issue especially in the PulseNet community where the network relies on this software to do many things including
genome assembly,
molecular typing,
and MLST.

Although these aren't recommendations from CDC, I wanted to list some viable alternatives.

## General

| software or site | Workflow language | Containerization | Cloud backend | notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| [Terra.bio](https://terra.bio/)        | WDL | Docker | Google | [SARS-CoV-2 protocols](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/toastpublic/publications), [terra.bio documentation](https://terra.bio/resources/getting-started/) |
| [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/) | NextFlow | Conda or Singularity | local | [documentation](https://bactopia.github.io/) |
| [StaPH-B Toolkit](https://staphb.org/staphb_toolkit/) | NextFlow | Docker or Singularity | local | [documentation](https://staphb.org/staphb_toolkit/) |
| [GalaxyTrakr](https://galaxytrakr.org/) | Galaxy | Galaxy environments | FDA cloud | [Documentation](https://galaxyproject.org/support/) |
| [IRIDA](https://sfu.irida.ca/) | Galaxy | Galaxy environments | PHAC cloud | [Documentation](http://www.irida.ca/getting-started/) |
| [EDGE](https://edgebioinformatics.org/) | Unsure | EDGE modules | local or on their website | [documentation](https://edgebioinformatics.org/) |

## Specific

Usually, a person just wants to replace one analysis such as genome assembly and so here are some options.

| analysis | BioNumerics software | alternative |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Genome assembly | SPAdes        | [Shovill with SPAdes](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill) |
| Serotyping (Salmonella) | SeqSero2 | [SeqSero2](http://www.denglab.info/SeqSero), [SISTR](https://lfz.corefacility.ca/sistr-app/) |
| 7-gene MLST | bespoke | Usually [_mlst_](https://github.com/tseemann/mlst) but this is a more comprehensive [comparison manuscript](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610716/) |
| cg/wgMLST | bespoke | [ChewBBACA](https://chewbbaca.online/), [ColorID](https://github.com/hcdenbakker/colorid), [EToKi](https://github.com/zheminzhou/EToKi). See also my [detailed usage post]({% post_url 2023-04-09-wgMLST %}). |
| SNP       | bespoke | [Lyve-SET](https://github.com/lskatz/lyve-SET), [CFSAN SNP-Pipeline](https://snp-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [SNVPhyl](https://github.com/phac-nml/irida/tree/master). See also our [comparison between SNP pipelines](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00375/full). |
