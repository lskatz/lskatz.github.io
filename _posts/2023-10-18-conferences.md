Every fiscal year, we have to predict where we are going to travel over the whole next year.
However, conferences mainly post on their own website, making no real central place where you can search for conferences.
I had to project my own travel for this coming year, as do many of my colleagues in government.
Therefore, I made it my mission over the last couple of days to figure out a list of conferences.

## Conferences

**Disclaimer** these data are not guaranteed to be correct and are just the best estimate we had at the time.
Please verify any conference that looks interesting to you and let me know if something needs updating.

## Methods

I started with a list of conferences that I developed internally with my colleagues,
and then I posted it to a larger group of bioinformaticians.
It turns out that [Ryan Connor](https://github.com/ArghSee) already had a large list that he created a couple years ago.
It was outdated but then again, it had URLs to conference websites and the names of the conferences.

Next, [Dave O'Connor](https://dho.pathology.wisc.edu/) gave me tips and very helpful discussions on how to prompt [Bing GPT](https://bing.com) to fill in the rest of the table values.
This gave me draft values for the next date of the conference, URLs, and regularity of the conference.
In many cases, these values were actually incorrect! And so I tried to quickly go through one by one to verify the URLs and find the next dates of the conference and update those.

## Epilogue

This process is far from perfect and so please contact me if you would like to help update this spreadsheet.
If you are reading this in time for 2024, please contact me to remind me to continue this project!
