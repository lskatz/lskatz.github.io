Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## Testing mermaid

I added this hidden test for mermaid on 2024-07-19

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Salmonella enterica"
    x-axis "Count per locus" [0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 11000, 12000, 13000, 14000, 15000]
    y-axis "Frequency" 0 --> 4400
    bar [4385, 859, 524, 436, 443, 514, 453, 361, 268, 125, 94, 48, 23, 13, 9, 2]
```
