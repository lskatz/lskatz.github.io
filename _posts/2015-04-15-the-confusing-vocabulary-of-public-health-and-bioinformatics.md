In the very beginning of our [Listeria project](http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/projects-item/whole-genome-sequencing-future-of-food-safety/), we basically had an idea that we could use evolution to help in epidemiological investigations.  The idea was out there in the world, and so I can't claim credit, but no one yet had the resources to sequence all Listeria monocytogenes genomes in a given area before HHS backed the project.  I would love to write more about this project actually but I digress.  
  
The point here is that we had a vocabulary problem.  In the beginning in the CDC lab (I can't say what all was happening in the other agencies), we had some of the best epidemiologists and some of the best Listeria microbiology experts in the room, and also one bioinformatician (me).   Thus, three different disciplines, one important project, and one huge vocabulary problem.  I tried collecting all the terms that everyone had to learn in the room but that started turning into epi/micro/bioinformatics notes and became too huge.  
  
Instead, I present here a list of confounding vocabulary terms that we all came into the room thinking we knew but instead had different meanings for different people.  I also present my own suggested disambiguation for these terms.
