I was inspired by Andrey Kislyuk's post about 15 years ago on his personal website where he formatted his personal website to look like a GenBank file. I recently looked it up and it has migrated to [kislyuk.com](https://kislyuk.com).
I found an online CV generator and modified it a bit and it was kind of fun to try this out. I didn't quite adhere to Andrey's format with things like `affiliation` tags but hey I felt like I did something and I learned the Shopify language along the way.
